# Install Scripts

### Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any harm caused to your system.

I have written these scripts to set up a fresh install of Ubuntu (fedora scripts are not updated). So DO NOT run these on your existing machine.

You are free to try them on a VM or a live USB :).
Just run `install.sh`
